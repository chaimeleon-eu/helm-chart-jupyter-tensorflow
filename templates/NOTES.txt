The application will be accesible in the following URL: 
  https://{{ include "chaimeleon.host" . }}/{{ include "jupyter-tensorflow.url-path" . }}/?token={{/* include "jupyter-tensorflow.access-token" . */}}

You can copy the access password from the secret named "container-password" (above in the right side of this page).

Once in the file explorer, there will be three important directories:
  - {{ include "chaimeleon.datasets.mount_point" . }}
    [All the datasets you selected to work with]
    
  - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_home.mount_point" . }}
    [Private persistent storage: for your algoritms, results and whatever you need for the work]
    
  - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_shared_folder.mount_point" . }}
    [Public storage where you can share files with the other CHAIMELEON users]
