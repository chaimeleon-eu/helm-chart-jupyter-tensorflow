When the application is ready it will be accessible via Guacamole in the following URL: 
  {{ include "chaimeleon.guacamole-url" . }}

There should be a connection created for this desktop with the following name: 
 + **{{ include "jupyter-tensorflow.connectionName" . }}**
It can take few seconds to appear (refresh the page if you do not see it).

**IMPORTANT:** This desktop may be removed automatically if you don't connect to it for more than 7 days.
               You should write all you want to save (algorithms, results of your jobs) in persistent-home (see below).

Once in the remote desktop, a browser should be automatically opened with Jupyter Notebooks.
If you close it, there is a shortcut in the desktop to open it again.

And remember...

    To show/hide the Guacamole menu: CTRL+SHIFT+ALT

    In the file explorer of Jupyter or Ubuntu desktop, there will be three important directories:
     - {{ include "chaimeleon.datasets.mount_point" . }}
       [All the datasets you selected to work with]

     - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_home.mount_point" . }}
       [Private persistent storage: for your algorithms, results and whatever you need for the work]

     - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_shared_folder.mount_point" . }}
        [Public storage where you can share files with the other CHAIMELEON users]
